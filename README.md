# PasswordGenerator
# <Your-Project-Title>
## Description

- My motivation for building this project was not being able to think of a secure password for my mutiple media accounts.

- i built this project to help me make secure passwords for me and my friends. I can add uppercase, lowercase, special, and numeric characters. I figured it would be a good learning exsperience as well. 
- it solves the problem of my passwords not being secure strengthening my passwords making my log in information more secure.
- I learnt java script math applications, and how to loop through arrays, and then to refresh the script and start like it had just begun.
